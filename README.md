# README â€“ LLMs in Mental Health Intake

## Overview

This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment or even partially replace the mental health intake process. There is a growing demand for mental health services with not enough providers. AI has the potential to automate certain tasks - freeing up providers to focus on their patients. Specifically, the paper investigates whether LLMs can conduct the nuanced task of initial patient intake, triaging severity, capturing relevant information in a way that can replace human intake.

The structure of the paper covers:

1. **Current mental health intake processes**
2. **Examples of how LLMs are currently being used in healthcare and mental health as a whole**
3. **Considerations for LLMs in an intake process**
4. **Prompting Examples**
5. **Brief overview of the future of LLMs in healthcare**
